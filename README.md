1) Are we okay with the state vectors and model using? What are we using?
2) How to implement the RBFs as a function basis and its grads?
3) Can we clean the code and add comments?
4) Exhaustive testing based on the trainings finalized (pick the ones working the best and keep track of the conditions working on MATLAB).
5)
