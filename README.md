# Vision-based Reactive control on UAVs for target tracking
This is a ROS C++ package of vision-based Reactive Control strategy for UAV aiming on target tracking. The general application of thiese controllers is a dynamic coastline in the presenc of waves. The different version of visual servoing will be analyzed belowThe controllers were all developed in a UAV synthetic simulation environment: https://github.com/sotomotocross/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter.git

# Things to Do 
1) Are we okay with the state vectors and model using? What are we using?
2) How to implement the RBFs as a function basis and its grads?
3) Can we clean the code and add comments?
4) Exhaustive testing based on the trainings finalized (pick the ones working the best and keep track of the conditions working on MATLAB).
5)
